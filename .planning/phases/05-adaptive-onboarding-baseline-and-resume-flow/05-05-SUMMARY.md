requires:
  - phase: 05-03
    provides: typed onboarding React Query hooks and recommendation response contract
  - phase: 05-04
    provides: auth response wiring that routes incomplete onboarding users into the multi-round flow
provides:
  - Stepper component for 3-round onboarding progress
  - WelcomeBackCard resume surface for incomplete onboarding
  - QuestionCard shared primitive for single-choice and multi-choice answers
  - RoundOne, RoundTwo, and RoundThree presentational renderers with typed submit payloads
  - RecommendationPanel confirm surface using backend learningPathId UUID
affects: [05-06, onboarding, recommendation-confirmation, resume-flow]

  patterns:
    - presentational onboarding components receiving server-backed props from container hooks
    - local round answer state with typed payload emission to parent container
    - shared accessible question rendering through a single QuestionCard primitive

key-decisions:
  - "Round renderer components keep answer state local and emit typed payloads upward so the future Onboarding container can own server mutations only."
  - "RecommendationPanel confirms recommendations with recommendation.learningPathId directly instead of resolving slugs on the frontend."
patterns-established:
  - "Question composition: every onboarding round delegates answer UI to QuestionCard for consistent accessibility and styling."
  - "Submit gating: each round disables the primary CTA until all questions are answered and the current submit is not pending."

# Phase 05 Plan 05: Frontend: Onboarding UI Components Summary

**Seven reusable onboarding UI components for resume flow, typed multi-round question rendering, and recommendation confirmation using backend UUIDs.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 21 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-25T16:03:23Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-25T16:18:55Z
- **Tasks:** 5
- **Files modified:** 7

## Accomplishments
- Added a mobile-safe `Stepper` that renders completed, current, and upcoming onboarding states with the required labels and connector colors.
- Built `QuestionCard` plus `RoundOne`, `RoundTwo`, and `RoundThree` so all rounds share one accessible answer primitive and emit typed payloads to the future container.
- Added `RecommendationPanel` that calls `onConfirm(recommendation.learningPathId)` to close the confirm-path UUID gap at the component layer.
- Finalized `WelcomeBackCard` resume copy and completed-round summary without exposing prior answers.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create Stepper component** - `718b784` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create WelcomeBackCard component** - `495491d` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create QuestionCard shared component** - `b4fcd01` (feat)
4. **Task 4: Create RoundOne, RoundTwo, RoundThree round renderer components** - `4be1e8d` (feat)
5. **Task 5: Create RecommendationPanel component with confirm integration** - `c40709d` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** `c3f7838` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified
- `/home/minhnhut_dev/projects/path-learn/frontend/src/components/onboarding/Stepper.tsx` - 3-step onboarding progress indicator with current/completed/upcoming states.
- `/home/minhnhut_dev/projects/path-learn/frontend/src/components/onboarding/WelcomeBackCard.tsx` - Resume card with locked Vietnamese copy and completed-round summary.
- `/home/minhnhut_dev/projects/path-learn/frontend/src/components/onboarding/QuestionCard.tsx` - Shared accessible answer card for radio and checkbox-style selections.
- `/home/minhnhut_dev/projects/path-learn/frontend/src/components/onboarding/RoundOne.tsx` - Baseline profile round renderer with typed `hoursPerWeek` conversion.
- `/home/minhnhut_dev/projects/path-learn/frontend/src/components/onboarding/RoundTwo.tsx` - Career-direction round renderer with local answer state and gated submit CTA.
- `/home/minhnhut_dev/projects/path-learn/frontend/src/components/onboarding/RoundThree.tsx` - Skill-assessment round renderer that converts selected ratings into `Record<string, number>`.
- `/home/minhnhut_dev/projects/path-learn/frontend/src/components/onboarding/RecommendationPanel.tsx` - Recommendation UI with source badge, chips, error banner, and UUID-based confirm callback.

## Decisions Made
- Kept round components presentational and mutation-agnostic so plan 05-06 can wire server state through hooks without reworking the visual layer.
- Used the existing UI primitives (`Card`, `Button`, `Badge`, `Alert`, `Progress`) instead of introducing new custom wrappers, which keeps onboarding aligned with the branch’s emerging design system.
- Mapped path slugs to Vietnamese display names inside `RecommendationPanel` while preserving `learningPathId` as the only confirm identifier.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
- Parallel branch activity had already introduced some related onboarding files, so Task 2 was finalized with a dedicated refinement commit to preserve an atomic commit boundary for this plan.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Plan 05-06 can now compose the onboarding container from `Stepper`, `WelcomeBackCard`, the three round renderers, and `RecommendationPanel`.
- Final `pnpm --dir frontend exec tsc --noEmit` verification passed with zero errors at the end of this plan.

## Self-Check

PASSED
- Found summary file at `/home/minhnhut_dev/projects/path-learn/.planning/phases/05-adaptive-onboarding-baseline-and-resume-flow/05-05-SUMMARY.md`
- Verified task commits `718b784`, `495491d`, `b4fcd01`, `4be1e8d`, and `c40709d` in git history
